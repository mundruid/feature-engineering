# feature-engineering

This repository includes cybersecurity open source data and feature engineering techniques that can be used with these data.

## How to use

1. Create a python virtual environment: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate it: `source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The Python code is in Jupyter notebooks. If you need more guidance on how to setup Jupyter notebooks, check my slides and instructions in [vs-code-ml](https://github.com/mundruid/vs-code-ml).
